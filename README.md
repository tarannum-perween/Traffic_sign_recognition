## Traffic_sign_recognition

- In this project, I build a deep neural network model to classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we will read and understand traffic signs essential for all autonomous vehicles.icles.

- The dataset I have used to train my traffic sign classifier is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).
- This GTSRB dataset consists of 43 traffic sign classes and nearly 50,000 images.

Model Accuracy is upto 95%.
