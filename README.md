## Traffic_sign_recognition

- In this project, I build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we will be able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

- The dataset I have used to train my traffic sign classifier is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).
- This GTSRB dataset consists of 43 traffic sign classes and nearly 50,000 images.

Model Accuracy is upto 95%.
